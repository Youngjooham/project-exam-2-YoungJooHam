## Description

### This website was made for my school Project Exam 2 

#### The brief: 

A newly launched accommodation booking site called Holidaze has approached you to develop a brand new front end for their application. While they have a list of required features, the design and user experience has not been specified. Working with the official API documentation, plan, design and build a modern front end accommodation booking application.

There are two aspects to this brief: the customer-facing side of the website where users can book holidays at a venue, and an admin-facing side of the website where users can register and manage venues and bookings at those venues.
